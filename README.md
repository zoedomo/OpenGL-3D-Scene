# OpenGL-3D-Scene
**************
**Overview**

This project is an implementation of a 3D graphics application using modern OpenGL, GLFW, and GLM libraries in C++. The main focus of this project is to render a rich and interactive 3D scene composed of various geometric shapes, including pyramids, spheres, planes, toruses, cubes, and cylinders. The application incorporates advanced graphics techniques like lighting, texturing, and camera controls, providing a solid foundation for further development into more complex 3D graphics applications.
****************
**Features**

3D Rendering: Utilizes OpenGL for rendering various 3D shapes with detailed texturing.

Shader Programming: Includes both vertex and fragment shaders for handling geometry transformations and basic lighting effects.

Lighting: Implements key and fill lighting, along with ambient light for a more realistic scene.

Camera Control: Interactive camera system allowing user movement through the scene.

Texture Mapping: Supports texture loading and mapping using stb_image.h for enhanced visual detail.

User Input: Processes user input for interactive scene exploration and window management.

**************
**Installation**

To run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

C++ Compiler (GCC or MSVC recommended)

OpenGL library

GLFW library

GLM library

stb_image.h for texture loading (included)
